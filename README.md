# Sizing Mongosync Host Servers: 
## Best Practices and Key Considerations

When migrating data from on-premises environments to MongoDB Atlas or synchronizing clusters across different environments, Mongosync serves as a powerful tool. However, the efficiency of this process heavily relies on properly sizing the host servers where Mongosync runs. 

Inadequate sizing can lead to performance bottlenecks, extended synchronization times, and even failures. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to ensure your Mongosync host servers are optimally sized.
