# Key Sizing Recommendations

## **1. CPU Sizing**
- Opt for modern multi-core processors to handle Mongosyncâ€™s concurrency requirements.
- For small datasets or low change rates, a 4-core CPU may suffice. For larger datasets, consider 8 or more cores.

## **2. Memory Allocation**
- Allocate at least **1 GB of RAM per 10 GB of data**.
- For clusters with high write volumes or complex document structures, increase memory proportionally.

## **3. Disk Performance**
- Use **SSDs** to reduce I/O latency.
- Ensure enough disk space for temporary files and logs, especially for large datasets.

## **4. Network Bandwidth**
- Use a high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection.
- Monitor network performance to avoid throttling during peak synchronization periods.
