# Tuning Mongosync Performance

To enhance performance, consider the following:

## **1. Configure Go Garbage Collection**
Mongosync, written in Go, relies on Go’s garbage collector. Proper tuning of garbage collection parameters can reduce CPU overhead.

Refer to the [Go Garbage Collection Guide](../resources/go-gc-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## **2. Adjust Batch Sizes**
- Use Mongosync’s batching mechanism to balance memory usage and throughput.

## **3. Optimize MongoDB Queries**
- Ensure indexes are in place to optimize read operations.
- Avoid unnecessary query projections that increase data size.
