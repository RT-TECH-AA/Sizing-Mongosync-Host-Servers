# Understanding Mongosync Requirements

Mongosync performs resource-intensive operations such as reading, transforming, and writing data. As such, its resource requirements—including CPU, memory, and storage—scale with the size and complexity of your data.

## **1. Data Size and Throughput**
- **Volume of Data**: The total size of your dataset significantly impacts Mongosync’s performance. Larger datasets require more memory to handle data transformations and buffering efficiently.
- **Change Rate**: For clusters with high write or update rates, ensure your host servers can keep up with the ongoing changes.

## **2. Concurrent Synchronization**
Running multiple Mongosync processes concurrently increases resource consumption. Plan for adequate CPU cores and memory to handle parallel operations.
